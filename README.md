# Machine Learning Algorithms from scratch
Python implementation of Andrew Ng's course and other machine learning algorithms (not included in the course).

All machine learning algorithms have been implemented using both numpy and scikit - learn and the datasets used have been included with the respective algorithms.

### Algorithm implementations till now:
  * Decision Trees
  * K-Means
  * KNN
  * Linear Regression
  * Logistic Regression
  * Naive Bayes Classifier 
  * Basic Neural Network
  * Support Vector Machines (SVM)
  * XGBoost

A short theory report of the same has been uploaded for a quick review behind the math and logic used in each algorithm.

More algorithms coming soon!

Thanks for visiting!
